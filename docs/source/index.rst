About FindFace Security
===========================


FindFace Security is a video-based biometric identification system that automates Security and Hospitality Operations Management.

FindFace Security detects and recognizes faces of the unwanted visitors and VIP guests in live video, and notifies security and hospitality managers about their arrival.

Early recognition of the arrival of unwanted visitors and VIP guests allows for solving the following problems:

* Operational losses due to visitors fraudulent activity
* Reputational losses and conflicts
* Better catering to the needs of VIP guests.

This guide is intended for FindFace Security administrators, security and hospitality managers, as well as for FindFace Security maintenance engineers.
