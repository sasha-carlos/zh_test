"FindFace Security verifies that a detected face and some face from the "
"dossiers belong to the same person (i. e. the faces match), based on the "
"pre-defined similarity threshold. The default threshold is set to 0.75 "
"which can be considered as optimum. If necessary, you can change the "
"threshold on the :guilabel:`Settings` tab."

"The higher is the threshold, the less are chances that a wrong person "
"will be positively verified, however, some valid photos may also fail "
