"A database which stores detailed and categorized dossiers of the unwanted"

"events. It also stores data for internal use such as user accounts and "
"camera settings. To be installed from the Ubuntu repository (along with "
"Redis)."

"A service which interfaces with all the components to provide the system "
"functioning. Includes ``findface-security-proto`` (provides HTTP and web "
"socket) and ``findface-security-worker`` (provides interaction between "
"the other system components). First, ``findface-security`` gets a "
"normalized image, full frame, and meta data of a detected face from "
"``fkvideo_detector``. It then redirects the normalized image to the "
"``extraction-api`` service to extract biometric data. The ``findface-"
"postgres-facen`` extension uses the face biometric data to find a set of "
"most similar faces in the dossiers. The face recognition event along with"
" the search result is then saved into the PostgreSQL database. You can "
"configure your system to save and display an event only if the similarity"
" between a detected face and some face in the dossiers exceeds a pre-"
"defined threshold, i. e. the faces match (the ``IGNORE_UNMATCHED`` option"
" at ``/etc/ffsecurity/config.py``, see :ref:`basic-deployment`). The "
"``ffsecurity`` service also provides a search engine that searches the "
"event database for a given face."
