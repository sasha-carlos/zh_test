.. warning::
   Before deploying FindFace Security, make sure that the system time and time zone are correct, and time synchronization via ``ntpd``/``systemd-timesyncd`` is enabled. When using FindFace Security, avoid any sudden changes in time, as they may result in unavailability of the FindFace Security services after reboot.  

.. tip::
   See :ref:`requirements` and :ref:`architecture`.
