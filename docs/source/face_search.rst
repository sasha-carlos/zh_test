Face Search
*******************************************

FindFace Security allows you to search for faces through the internal (event list) and external (social network vk.com) databases by using an event ID or a photo.

To find a face, do the following:

#. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Search` tab.
 
    |search_en|

    .. |search_ru| image:: /_static/search.png
       :scale: 60%

    .. |search_en| image:: /_static/search_en.png
       :scale: 60%  

#. Select a database to search: :guilabel:`Events` or :guilabel:`Social networks`.
#. Specify an event that features the face you want to find, or upload a photo. The relevant image will be displayed in the :guilabel:`Photo` area. If there are multiple faces in the image, select the one you want.
#. By default, the system searches for faces using the identification threshold ``0.75``. If necessary, set your own value.
#. (Optional) When searching the event list, specify a group of cameras and a time period within which the event occurred.
#. Click :guilabel:`Search`. You will see the search results appear below. For each face found, the matching confidence level is provided.
