Web Interface
**********************************

Use the web interface to interact with FindFace Security. To open the web interface, enter its basic address in the address bar of your browser, and log in.

   .. note::
      The basic address is set as ``EXTERNAL ADDRESS`` in the ``/etc/ffsecurity/config.py`` configuration file.

   .. important::
      To log in for the first time, use the ``admin`` account created during the :ref:`basic configuration  <basic-deployment>` installation. 

The web interface has a highly intuitive and handy design and provides the following functionality:

* :ref:`cameras`. Group cameras subject to their location. Add and configure a camera
* :ref:`guests`. Manage dossier classification lists. Create dossiers manually and in bulk
* :ref:`users`. Manage FindFace Security users
* View and process face recognition events and search for faces in the event list and social networks (see :ref:`manager-guide`).
