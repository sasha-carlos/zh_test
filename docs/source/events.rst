List of Events
===============================

Once a face detected, you will see a notification in the event list.

A notification can feature different pieces of information, depending on whether a detected face has a match in the database:

* Match not found: normalized face image, detection date and time, camera group name.
* Match found: normalized face image, photo from the dossier, the person name, similarity between the faces, comment from the dossier, watch list name, detection date and time, camera group name.

.. note::
   You can configure the system in such a way that you will get notifications only for the faces with a match.

.. important::
   In order to pause the notifications thread, click |pause| above the list of events.

* :guilabel:`Dossier`: display events only for a selected dossier.
* :guilabel:`Watch lists`: display events only for a selected dossier category (watch list).
* :guilabel:`Matches`: display events only with/without matches, or all events.
* :guilabel:`Acknowledged`: display only acknowledged/unacknowledged events, or all events.
* :guilabel:`Cameras`: display only events from a selected camera.
* :guilabel:`Camera groups`: display only events from a selected group of cameras.
* :guilabel:`Start`, :guilabel:`End`: display only events occurred within a certain time period.
* :guilabel:`id`: display an event with a given ID.


Event Ticket. Acknowledging Event
====================================================

In order to navigate to an event ticket from the list of events, click on the face recognition result in a notification (:guilabel:`No matches` or the name of a matching person).

An event ticket contains the same data as a relevant :ref:`notification <event-list>`. It also allows for acknowledging the event. To do so, check :guilabel:`Acknowledge event`. Click :guilabel:`Save`.
